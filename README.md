BTV Consensus Sequence Generation - Long-Read Nextflow Pipeline 
Created by Tillie Dunham on 06.21.24

This pipeline is written in nextflow and generates a consensus sequence for Bluetongue virus (BTV) from reads generated using long-read Oxford Nanopore technology. 

The input to this pipeline is: 
  concatenated fastq file of all long reads for the sample
  BTV reference sequence
